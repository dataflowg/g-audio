These VIs contain the top level malleable VI calls used in G-Audio.

They are to be used as inputs to the malleable to polymorphic converter (https://github.com/dataflowg/malleable-to-polymorphic) for generating a polymorphic version of the library, originally intended for creating a LabVIEW NXG version of the libray.

These template VIs were included in the G-Audio project, but they cause massive slowdowns when loading the project, and are painfully slow to open.
